This project was to really dive into what it would be like to actually build a platformer game, one of my favorite genres of video games.
Turns out, there are a few interesting development roadblocks.

The game itself is basic, but the real treat is the map maker. Use your mouse to drag walls. More features planned for the future.

When you first download, there will be no maps. You'll have to make your own, before you can play. Run mapmaker.py to create maps, and driver.py to play them.
